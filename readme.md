# Firebase Issue Tracker
a Full stack web application for creating and tracking Issue, built with React as the fron-end and Firebase as back-end. Firebase Service that I use for this project is Firebase Firestore Database and Firebase Authentication.

## Technology Used
For this project I'm using React, Firebase Firestore, and Firebase Authentication, and also using Bootstrap for creating simple and clean ui.

## The Challenges
The major challenge of making this App is the Back-end. I overcome this by using Firebase so I don't have to configure the back-end from scratch because Firebase is a back-end as service (baas) so everything is alredy setup by the Firebase I just have to connect my App to Firebase for the back-end service.

# React Movie App
This is a single page web app built with React to looking for an info about a movie. This apps using external api from [OMDb API](http://ombdapi). 

## Technology Used
Create-React-App, React Router, BootstrapCSS, and restful API from http://omdbapi.com.

## The Challenges
One of the challenge of this projects is to create individual page of the movie that is selected after querying from the main page. To solve this problem I'm using React Router to create the page systematically by routing the ID of a movie to a new page and displaying the info based on that movie ID from the external API.
