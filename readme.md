# React Movie App
This is a single page web app built with React to looking for an info about a movie. This apps using external api from [OMDb API](http://ombdapi). 

## Technology Used
Create-React-App, React Router, BootstrapCSS, and restful API from http://omdbapi.com.

## The Challenges
One of the challenge of this projects is to create individual page of the movie that is selected after querying from the main page. To solve this problem I'm using React Router to create the page systematically by routing the ID of a movie to a new page and displaying the info based on that movie ID from the external API.
